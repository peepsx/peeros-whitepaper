## Abstract
A purely peer-to-peer (P2P) version of the operating system (OS) would not only greatly increase the adoption rate of the decentralized web, it would birth a decentralized software revolution that could change the very fabric of the world as we know it. Developers would be given various incentives to develop decentralized alternatives to the centralized applications we use everyday, for users who would also be given financial incentives to use them. Applications would utilize cryptography-based privacy and security libraries made available at the systems level of peerOS, rather than in a web browser or in an untrustworthy, closed-source operating system. Unlike a traditional operating system, peerOS would utilize blockchains, smart contracts and several "off-chain" P2P protocols for its core operations, as well as the operations of many of its standard decentralized applications (dApps). This means peerOS would be much more lightweight than a traditional operating system and computers running on peerOS could not become individually infected with malware, due to the very nature of the P2P protocols peerOS' core libraries are built upon. Even if a P2P network were attacked, issues related to the attack would be resolved long before most users of peerOS would have ever noticed the attack and their data would remain cryptographically secured on the P2P networks peerOS is integrated with, during and after the attack itself. As a result, the peer-to-peer operating system we are proposing would be much more secure, would enable actual privacy for its users and would be much faster than the operating systems of old, while also featuring applications that would not only rival their centralized counterparts with functionality but would also financially benefit the developers and users of these applications in ways these old alternatives could not. Simply put, peerOS would put the privacy and security of its users into the hands of the people that are collectively building and using the platform, not only at the systems level but at the application level as well. In-turn the peerOS community would also operate within a decentralized economy of its own, benefiting its developers and users through various decentralized cryptographic currencies, in order to further the operating system itself, as well as the applications that live within it. Therefore, peerOS is a new kind of operating system that's powered, developed and secured by the people who use it, instead of the big corporations that seek to control them.
